#### 2. Add Shutdown Button
**Evidence:** 2 occurrences

Add button with input to the **Actions** section:
```javascript
function addShutdownNote() {
    const equipment = window.prompt('What equipment/circuit did you shutdown?');
    if (equipment !== null && equipment.trim() !== '') {
        addQuickNote('Shutdown ' + equipment.trim() + '.');
    }
}
```

**Citations:**

    }
}
```

### 🔄 Workflow Patterns Detected

#### Pattern 1: Complete Diagnostic Check
**Frequency:** 20+ variations  
**Pattern:** Login → Check Comms → Check Temps → Check Alarms → Status

**Recommendation:** Consider composite button that adds:  
`Checked comms. Checked temps. Checked alarms.`

#### Pattern 2: Comm Loss Investigation  
**Frequency:** 17+ instances  
**Current Coverage:** ✅ Good (already have "Comms ✗" and "Tech T/S" buttons)

#### Pattern 3: Defrost Management
**Frequency:** 15+ instances  
**Current Coverage:** ✅ Excellent (Defrost button with circuit input)

### ✅ What's Already Working Well

Your current Quick Notes system has **excellent coverage** of:
- System logins (all platforms)
- Basic diagnostics (comms, temps, alarms, clocks)
- Defrost operations
- All download types
- Status indicators
- Power cycle and NSRM advisories

---

### 📈 Impact Analysis

**Before Recommendations:**
- Button coverage: ~85%
- Manual typing: ~15% of notes

**After Implementing Recommendations:**
- Button coverage: ~95%
