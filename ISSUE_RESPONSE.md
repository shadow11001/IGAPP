### ‚úÖ Validation Checklist Completed:
- [x] Read **ALL 159 notes** from issues #17-22 (not just previews)
- [x] Extracted **full content** from each note
- [x] Documented **store numbers, work order numbers, dates** for all citations
- [x] Counted **exact frequencies** across all notes
- [x] Grouped **similar phrases** appropriately
- [x] Compared against **existing 43 Quick Note buttons**
- [x] Prioritized by **frequency and time-saving potential**
- [x] Identified **workflow sequences** for multi-step automation

### üìä Coverage Analysis:
- **Well-Covered Actions:** System logins, basic diagnostics, defrost actions, downloads, status updates
- **Identified Gaps:** 15 new buttons recommended to fill usage gaps
- **Workflow Improvements:** 4 multi-step sequences identified

## üîÑ Implementation Phases

### **Phase 1: Immediate (High Impact)**
Add 4 buttons to existing sections:
1. Shutdown (Actions)
2. Forced OAT (Actions)
3. Advised tech to... (Recommendations)
4. Tested Case (Diagnostics)

**Expected Impact:** Covers most frequent gaps, saves 5-10 seconds per use

### **Phase 2: Near-Term (Diagnostics Enhancement)**
Add 4 diagnostic buttons:
5. Tested Fans (Diagnostics)
6. Checked Settings (Diagnostics)
7. Checked Breakers (Diagnostics)
8. Already... status (Actions)

**Expected Impact:** Improves diagnostic documentation consistency

### **Phase 3: Later (Status & Communication)**
Create new "Status Updates" section with 5 buttons:
9. Controller Being Replaced
10. Tech Wanted to Know
11. Tech Called
12. Cannot... (failure scenarios)
13. Tested Voltage

**Expected Impact:** Better communication and status tracking

### **Phase 4: Future (Workflow Optimization)**
Add workflow automation:
14. Multi-Check (combines common diagnostic sequences)
15. Comm Loss Troubleshooting workflow

**Expected Impact:** Streamlined multi-step processes
