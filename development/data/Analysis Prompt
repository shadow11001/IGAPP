Comprehensive Notes Analysis Prompt
TASK: Systematically analyze ALL sub-issues from the usage report to identify patterns and recommend new Quick Note buttons based on ACTUAL user data.

Step-by-Step Analysis Instructions:
1. Data Collection Phase
Read EVERY sub-issue from the usage report (Issues #17-22)
Extract the full content from each note (not just previews)
Document the following for each note:

Store number
Work order number
Date
Full notes content
DAE content (if any)
Tech name

2. Pattern Identification Phase
For each note, identify:

Action verbs (called, contacted, checked, reset, etc.)
Equipment references (controller, rack, RTU, etc.)
Troubleshooting steps (power cycle, reboot, download, etc.)
Communication patterns (tech called back, contacted support, etc.)
Resolution methods (issue resolved, escalated, monitoring, etc.)

3. Frequency Analysis
Count exact phrases that appear multiple times across notes
Group similar actions (e.g., "called tech", "called technician", "contacted tech")
Identify equipment-specific patterns (e.g., "reset controller", "power cycled RTU")
Track communication flows (e.g., "tech called back", "left voicemail")

4. Citation Requirements
For EVERY recommendation, provide:

Exact quote from the original note
Issue number and note number where found
Work order number for reference
Frequency count across all notes
Date range of occurrences

5. Button Recommendation Format
For each suggested button:

```
**Button Name:** [Exact text for button]
**Frequency:** Found in X notes
**Citations:**- Issue #17, Note 5, WO: WO123456, Date: 2025-01-15  Quote: "contacted tech to advise of issue"- Issue #18, Note 12, WO: WO789012, Date: 2025-01-16  Quote: "called tech back with update"
**Suggested Button Text:** "Contacted tech"
**Category:** Communication/Actions/Status/etc.
```

6. Validation Criteria
Only recommend buttons if:

Minimum 3 occurrences across different notes
Consistent phrasing or easily groupable variations
Clear time-saving potential (replacing manual typing)
Not already covered by existing Quick Note buttons

7. Analysis Depth Requirements
Read the complete note content, not just summaries
Look for both explicit and implicit patterns
Consider context (what led to the action, what followed)
Identify workflow sequences (e.g., checked → reset → verified)

8. Output Structure
Organize findings into:

High Priority (5+ occurrences, clear patterns)
Medium Priority (3-4 occurrences, good patterns)
Workflow Sequences (multi-step processes that could be automated)
Equipment-Specific (buttons for specific hardware/software)
Communication Templates (standard phrases for customer interaction)
Quality Assurance Checklist
Before providing recommendations, verify:

 Read ALL sub-issues completely
 Extracted actual note content (not previews)
 Provided specific citations with issue/note numbers
 Counted exact frequencies
 Grouped similar phrases appropriately
 Considered existing Quick Note buttons to avoid duplicates
 Prioritized by frequency and time-saving potential
