## HIGH PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS (5+ occurrences)

### 1. "Shutdown" Button
**Frequency:** Found in 5+ distinct notes  
**Category:** Actions  
**Suggested Button Text:** "Shutdown [equipment]"

#### Citations:
- **Issue #17, Note 15**, WO: 326457009, Store: 3730  
  Quote: "Logged into Opus Mag. **Shutdown B2 and B3**"
  
- **Issue #19, Note 65**, WO: 327116940, Store: 1384  
  Quote: "Logged into Opus Arch. **Shutdown circuit A3**"

**Justification:** Users frequently need to shut down specific equipment (circuits, compressors, etc.). Currently no dedicated shutdown button exists. This action is distinct from "Forced Off" as it implies a complete system shutdown rather than forcing off a parameter.

**Recommended Implementation:**
```javascript
onclick="addQuickNoteWithInput('Shutdown ', 'Enter equipment (circuit, compressor, etc.):')"
```

---

### 2. "Already Defrosting" / "Already Terminated" Button
**Frequency:** 3+ occurrences  
**Category:** Actions / Status  
**Suggested Button Text:** "Already defrosting"

#### Citations:
- **Issue #17, Note 11**, WO: 327099489, Store: 1445  
  Quote: "Logged into Novar. **B2 already terminated defrost.**"
  
- **Issue #17, Note 19**, WO: 327099461, Store: 4738  
  Quote: "Logged into Opus Mag. **BS02 already defrosting.**"

**Justification:** Technicians often find equipment already in the desired state when they log in. This saves time typing a common scenario where action was already taken or is already occurring.

**Recommended Implementation:**
```javascript
onclick="addQuickNoteWithInput('', 'Enter status (e.g., \"B2 already defrosting\" or \"A3 already terminated defrost\"):')"
```

---

### 3. "Tested Case" / "Tested Case Temps" Button
**Frequency:** 8+ occurrences (from parent issue #16)  
**Category:** Diagnostics  
**Suggested Button Text:** "Tested Case"

#### Citations:

- **Issue #20, Note 100**, WO: 327757857, Store: 5096  
  Quote: "Logged into Opus Mag. Checked comms. Still in comm loss. **Tested case temps. Tested case temp probes.** All good. Advised to monitor and call back if issues persist."

**Justification:** Testing case temperatures and probes is a common diagnostic step not currently covered by existing buttons. The data shows this is used frequently enough to warrant a dedicated button.

**Recommended Implementation:**
```javascript
onclick="addTestNote()" // Modify existing Test button to include "case temps" as a preset option
// OR add dedicated button:
onclick="addQuickNote('Tested case temps.')"
```

---

### 4. "Tested Fans" Button
**Frequency:** 2+ direct occurrences

  Quote: "Logged into Novar. **Tested fans.** Checked temps. Checked alarms. Tech will troubleshoot."

**Justification:** Testing fans (RTU fans, condenser fans, etc.) is a common troubleshooting step. Currently users must use the generic "Test" button or type manually.

**Recommended Implementation:**
```javascript
onclick="addQuickNote('Tested fans.')"
```

---

### 5. "Forced OAT" Button  
**Frequency:** 4+ occurrences (from parent issue #16: "forced oat" used 4 times)  
**Category:** Actions  
**Suggested Button Text:** "Forced OAT"

#### Citations:
